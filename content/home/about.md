# Biography

I am a PhD student at the Unit of Biostatistics since October 2015. My interests involve mathematical statistics and applied probability, more specifically, I am fascinated by topics that relate to stochastic processes and their estimation. I am driven by the idea of using mathematics to improve other fields of research and have impact on real-world problems, like those encountered within medical sciences.

From September 2017 I am a visiting Ph. D. student at the Division of Mathematical Statistics, Department of Mathematics, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).
