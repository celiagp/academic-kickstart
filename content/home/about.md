# About me

I am a PhD student at the Unit of Biostatistics since October 2015. My interests involve mathematical statistics and applied probability, more specifically, I am fascinated by topics that relate to stochastic processes and their estimation. I am driven by the idea of using mathematics to improve other fields of research and have impact on real-world problems, like those encountered within medical sciences.

From September 2017 I am a visiting Ph. D. student at the Division of Mathematical Statistics, Department of Mathematics, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH).

<!--- (I studied pure Mathematics at the University of Barcelona), where I graduated in June 2012. After that I enrolled in the Master in Statistics and Operations Research at BarcelonaTech, where I specialized in biostatistics and took courses in survival and longitudinal analysis, and design of clinical trials, among others. I conducted my Master thesis titled: "Compounded life expectancy with random censored data" at the Unit of Biostatistics, IMM, Karolinska Institutet, where I started working as a research assistant in February 2014. I was teaching assistant for various Ph. D. courses in biostatistics and collaborated with epidemiology groups at my department. I was also Visiting Program coordinator. 

From October 2015, I am a Ph. D. candidate at the Unit of Biostatistics. 

In September 2017 I joint the Division of Mathematical Statistics, Department of Mathematics, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), where I am working as a visiting Ph. D. student.

# Research

My interests involve mathematical statistics and applied probability, more specifically, I am fascinated by topics that relate to stochastic processes and their estimation. I am driven by the idea of using mathematics to improve other fields of research and have impact on real-world problems, like those encountered within medical sciences.

I am currently working in a number of projects that range from the development of new informative summary measures to several aspects of probabilistic models for evolutionary biology.--->
