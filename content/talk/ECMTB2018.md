# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Increased availability of molecular phylogenetic information has triggered the development of new models and computational methods in evolutionary biology. Detection of co-evolution mechanisms at the molecular level is of great interest in this context, as it is key for the study of genetic variants associated with numerous diseases. The coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion, a multilocus and multiallele diffusion model recently proposed by Timo Koski and Erik Aurell, aims to characterize the evolution of pairwise interactions between allele types at different loci. Expressed as a system of stochastic differential equations, the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion includes coupling terms, one added to each drift, that reflect the nature of such interactions. While simulation methods for other diffusion processes have been widely studied, exact simulation methods for the coupled Wright Fisher diffusion are currently unavailable. We propose an exact rejection algorithm for coupled Wright-Fisher diffusions, extending the simulation techniques presented in Jenkins (2017). Our algorithm uses as candidates independent Wright-Fisher processes for which exact simulation is possible, and imposes only mild conditions on the coupling terms, covering a wide range of coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion models that include mutation and selection."
