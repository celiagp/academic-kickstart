# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Allele frequency time series data are becoming widely available, fostering the study of evolutionary forces such as mutation or selection. In this context, questions arise about how genetic variants associated to numerous diseases co-evolve in time. The coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion model, proposed by Timo Koski and Erik Aurell, is a novel multilocus and multiallele model that tracks possible pairwise allele interactions across loci, in an haploid asexually reproducing population. Expressed as a system of stochastic differential equations, the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion includes coupling terms, one added to each drift, that parametrize such interactions. Extending a simulation technique presented in Jenkins and Span√≤ [2017], we propose an exact rejection algorithm for coupled Wright-Fisher diffusions. Preliminary results suggest that multidimensional (independent) Wright-Fisher processes with the same drift function as the coupled targets, could result in good candidates in a rejection algorithm."
